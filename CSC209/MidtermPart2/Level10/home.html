The role of the link tage in the head of the navBar file is to link external
files like css stylesheets to the html pages. Some information it contributes is
styling like what weight/size the font is or the background color of the website
and this information is usually used by attributes in the body of the html page.

  Level 10 status: In Vertical tabs, I did something similar in Level 9 but with
  Vertical tabs, where the number of tabs can be created based on a global
  variable. I also added a checkbox feature that changes the background color to
  green. I linked the verticalTab html to the Schedule icon. CSS and JS are in
  external files.
