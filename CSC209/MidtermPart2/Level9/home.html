The role of the link tage in the head of the navBar file is to link external
files like css stylesheets to the html pages. Some information it contributes is
styling like what weight/size the font is or the background color of the website
and this information is usually used by attributes in the body of the html page.

<p>
  Level 9 status: Made dynamic javascript code that creates any number of links.
  I assume that links and name of the tab name are inputted through an array
  first. Ensured all code is readable.
